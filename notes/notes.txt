Containing Floats

http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/

Rather than clearing floats, another option is to contain the floats. The outcomes of containing floats versus those of clearing them are nearly the same; however, containing floats does help to ensure that all of our styles will be rendered properly.

To contain floats, the floated elements must reside within a parent element. The parent element will act as a container, leaving the flow of the document completely normal outside of it.

This is how "clearfix" or "cf" classes work. We are nameing the class "group" instead, since it better expresses the content.

HTML
=====================
<header>...</header>
<div class="group">
  <section>...</section>
  <aside>...</aside>
</div>
<footer>...</footer>

CSS
=====================
.group:before,
.group:after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
}
.group:after {
  clear: both;
}
.group {
  clear: both;
  *zoom: 1;
}
